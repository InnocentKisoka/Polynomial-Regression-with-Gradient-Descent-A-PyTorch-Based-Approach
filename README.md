Polynomial Regression with Gradient Descent ðŸš€

This repository implements Polynomial Regression using Gradient Descent with PyTorch. The project includes generating noisy data from a given polynomial, visualizing the data, and estimating polynomial coefficients through linear regression. Key features include:
Polynomial Plotting: Visualize the true polynomial and learned approximations.
Dataset Generation: Create noisy datasets with customizable parameters.
Gradient Descent Training: Train the model with adjustable learning rates and iterations.
Performance Analysis: Monitor training/validation losses and parameter convergence.
Bonus Task: Empirical analysis of function learning performance under different intervals.
ðŸ“Š The project also explores hyperparameter tuning, adaptive methods, and the impact of learning rates.
